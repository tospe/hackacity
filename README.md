# Fraunhofer Spaghettis @ Hackacity Porto 2022

This repo has the code made by Fraunhofer Spaghettis (@Eduardo-LP-Silva, @pedroalopes, @tospe) for [Hackacity](https://hackacity.eu). 

Main idea:
- divide the city of porto in Hexagons (best shape to divide the geospace), perishes are too big.
- obtain data from [Porto Digital](https://portodigital.pt) related to the amount of things to do (museums, attractions, art, etc) and the flow of people
- obtain a metric between the supply of things to do in a specific hexagon and the demand of people
